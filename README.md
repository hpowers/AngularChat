# Angular Demo Project - Chat App

v 0.1 - some basic features

You should be able to run it locally with
* npm i
* node app.js
* open http://localhost:3000 in chrome

It will also deploy to heroku
* heroku create
* git push heroku master

You can sometimes find it running on heroku at [http://agile-cove-4799.herokuapp.com/](http://agile-cove-4799.herokuapp.com/)
